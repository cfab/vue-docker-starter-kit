# frontend-docker-starter-kit
A template to start frontend projects with docker.
The motivation behind this is that the only dependency you need to install is docker, everything else will be installed and run inside containers.
This makes starting new projects faster, it helps onboarding new team-mates, and makes it easy to switch between projects as it gives a consistant way of building and running our apps.
